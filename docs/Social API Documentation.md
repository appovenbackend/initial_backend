## üìã **Complete Connection/Social API Documentation**

### **üîê Authentication & Common Setup**

- **Base URL**: `/social`
- **Authentication**: `X-User-ID` header (simplified for testing; production uses JWT)
- **Database**: Uses `user_connections` table (formerly `user_follows`)

---

## **üë§ User Profile Endpoints**

### **1. Get User Profile**

```http
GET /social/users/{user_id}
```

**What it does:**

- Retrieves detailed user profile information with privacy controls
- Shows different information based on viewer's relationship to the user

**How it works:**

1. **Authentication**: Extracts current user ID from `X-User-ID` header
2. **Data Retrieval**: Loads user data and connection records from database
3. **Privacy Check**: Uses `_can_view_profile()` to determine visibility
4. **Profile Building**: Calls `_build_profile_response()` with privacy filtering
5. **Relationship Status**: Includes connection status between viewer and target

**Request:**

```http
GET /social/users/user456
Headers: X-User-ID: user123
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "user456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "picture": null,
  "bio": "Fitness enthusiast",
  "is_private": false,
  "connections_count": 5,
  "strava_link": "https://strava.com/athletes/123",
  "instagram_id": "@johndoe",
  "subscribed_events": ["event1", "event2"],
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00",
  "is_connected": true,
  "connection_status": "accepted"
}
```

**Privacy Logic:**

- **Public Profile** (`is_private: false`): Full info visible to everyone
- **Private Profile** (`is_private: true`): Limited info to non-connections, full info to connections
- **Hidden Fields**: Phone and email are never shown (privacy decision)

---

### **2. Update Privacy Settings**

```http
PUT /social/users/{user_id}/privacy?is_private={bool}
```

**What it does:**

- Allows users to toggle their profile privacy setting
- Controls who can see their full profile information

**How it works:**

1. **Authorization**: Verifies current user owns the profile
2. **Validation**: Updates `is_private` field in user record
3. **Persistence**: Saves changes to database
4. **Response**: Returns new privacy status

**Request:**

```http
PUT /social/users/user123/privacy?is_private=true
Headers: X-User-ID: user123
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Account set to private",
  "is_private": true
}
```

**Business Rules:**

- Users can only update their own privacy settings
- Changes take effect immediately for all profile views

---

## **ü§ù Connection Management Endpoints**

### **3. Request Connection**

```http
POST /social/users/{user_id}/connect
```

**What it does:**

- Initiates a connection request between users
- Auto-accepts for public profiles, creates pending request for private profiles

**How it works:**

1. **Validation**: Checks if users aren't already connected or have pending requests
2. **Self-Connection Check**: Prevents users from connecting to themselves
3. **Privacy-Based Logic**:
   - **Public target**: Auto-accepts connection
   - **Private target**: Creates pending request
4. **Database Update**: Creates new record in `user_connections` table
5. **Response**: Returns connection status and message

**Request:**

```http
POST /social/users/user456/connect
Headers: X-User-ID: user123
```

**Response (Public Target):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Connected with John Doe",
  "status": "accepted"
}
```

**Response (Private Target):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Connection request sent to John Doe",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

**Database Record Created:**

```json
{
  "id": "conn_abc123",
  "follower_id": "user123", // Requester
  "following_id": "user456", // Target
  "status": "accepted", // or "pending"
  "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00"
}
```

---

### **4. Remove Connection**

```http
DELETE /social/users/{user_id}/disconnect
```

**What it does:**

- Removes existing connection or pending request between users
- Works in both directions (follower/following)

**How it works:**

1. **Authentication**: Identifies current user
2. **Connection Lookup**: Finds connection record in either direction
3. **Validation**: Ensures connection exists
4. **Deletion**: Removes record from database
5. **Response**: Confirms disconnection

**Request:**

```http
DELETE /social/users/user456/disconnect
Headers: X-User-ID: user123
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Connection removed"
}
```

---

## **üì® Connection Request Management**

### **5. Get Pending Requests**

```http
GET /social/connection-requests
```

1. **Authentication**: Gets current user ID
2. **Query Database**: Finds all pending requests targeting current user
3. **Profile Building**: Builds profile responses for each requester
4. **Response**: Returns list of pending requests with requester details

**Request:**

```http
GET /social/connection-requests
Headers: X-User-ID: user123
```

**Response:**

```json

      "bio": "Runner from Mumbai",
      "is_private": false,
      "connections_count": 2,
      "strava_link": null,
      "instagram_id": null,
      "subscribed_events": [],
      "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00",
      "is_connected": false,
      "connection_status": null
    },
    "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00"
  }
]
```

4. **Status Update**: Changes status to "accepted"
5. **Timestamp Update**: Sets updated_at timestamp
6. **Persistence**: Saves changes to database

**Request:**

```http
POST /social/connection-requests/conn_abc123/accept

**What it does:**

- Declines a pending connection request
- Removes the request entirely from database

**How it works:**

1. **Authorization**: Verifies current user is the request target
2. **Request Lookup**: Finds specific request by ID
3. **Validation**: Ensures request exists and user is authorized
4. **Deletion**: Removes request record from database
5. **Response**: Confirms request declined

**Request:**

```http
POST /social/connection-requests/conn_abc123/decline
Headers: X-User-ID: user123
